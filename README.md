# unit-testing
This is a new project I have just created in May 2016 whilst learning to unit test my JavaScript. I am using Mocha as a unit test framework, and Chai as an accompanying expectation library.

Important: when you first clone this repository, you need to run the following command in command prompt or git bash:

<i>npm install --save-dev mocha chai</i>

This will install mocha and chai within the current repository.

Once you have done this, use the following command to execute all of the unit tests:

<i>npm test</i>
